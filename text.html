    <p class="first"><b id="bold">One </b> day, Neelam the crow was flying over the trees. She was hungry. She was looking for something to eat. She found a piece of cheese under a tree. “How lucky I am!” said Neelam to herself.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="pictire2.webp" alt="">
    <p class="second">She picked up the piece of cheese with her beak and flew to the top of the tree. “I shall eat this piece of cheese slowly,” said Neelam to herself. “I have not eaten cheese for a long time. I love cheese.”</p>
    <br>
    <img src="picture3.webp" alt="">
    <p class="third">Foxy the fox was walking near the tree. He too was hungry. “I have not eaten anything all day. I am so hungry. I hope I find something to eat,” thought Foxy.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="forth">Foxy saw Neelam sitting on the tree and he also saw the cheese.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="picture5.webp" alt="">
    <p class="fifth">“I must get that piece of cheese from Neelam. But Neelam is very clever. I have to make Neelam drop the cheese.”</p>
    <br>
    <img src="picture6.webp" alt="">
    <p class="sixth">Foxy thought of a plan. He went to the tree where Neelam was sitting and said, “Oh, what a beautiful bird you are! I am sure you have a beautiful voice too. Why don’t you sing for me?”</p>
    <br>
    <img src="picture7.webp" alt="">
    <p class="seventh">Neelam was very happy when she heard these words. She forgot the cheese was in her mouth. She opened her mouth to crow and the cheese fell out.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="picture8.webp" alt="">
    <p class="eigth">Foxy ate the cheese. He laughed at Neelam and said, “You have an ugly voice. I only wanted the cheese. You are a fool!”</p>
